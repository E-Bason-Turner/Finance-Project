# Finance-Project
This project was completed as the final project for the class Math 5760 by Evan Turner and Zach Archibald using partner programming techniques. 
It parses stock data from a txt file and simulates an SDE system in order to generate predictions of the behavior of a correlated system of stocks during the same time interval as the original data.
The program prints the stock data into a txt file called SimulatedTrajectories.txt. The program allows the user to download the stock data as a csv file and then convert it to a txt file for use without edits.
The program is equipped to upsample the data by a factor of 5 in order to better simulate the daily fluctuations of stocks.
